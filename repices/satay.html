        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Sate (Also spelled <strong>satay</strong>) </h3>
        <p><strong>Satay</strong> is a popular Southeast Asian dish consisting of seasoned, skewered, and grilled meat, often served with a rich peanut sauce. Originating in Indonesia, satay is now enjoyed in many countries, including Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. The meat—commonly chicken, beef, lamb, or goat—is marinated in a mixture of spices and herbs, then grilled over charcoal to give it a smoky, flavorful aroma. Satay is typically served with rice cakes (called <em>lontong</em>  or <em>ketupat</em>), sliced cucumbers, onions, and a savory peanut sauce that adds a creamy, slightly sweet, and spicy flavor. It is a beloved street food and a favorite dish during festivals and gatherings.</p>
        <p>Indonesia is home to a wide variety of satay, each region offering its own unique twist on this beloved dish. From Sabang to Merauke, satay (or <em>sate</em>, in Indonesian) is more than just skewered meat—it reflects the rich cultural and culinary diversity of the archipelago. There are over 30 known regional variations of satay, each differing in the choice of meat, marinades, sauces, and cooking techniques.</p>
        <p>Some of the most famous types include <strong>Sate Madura</strong>, known for its sweet and savory peanut sauce; <strong>Sate Padang</strong>, with its thick, spicy yellow sauce made from turmeric and rice flour; and <strong>Sate Lilit</strong> from Bali, where minced meat is mixed with grated coconut and wrapped around lemongrass sticks instead of skewers. There's also <strong>Sate Maranggi</strong> from West Java, which is marinated in a blend of vinegar and spices, and <strong>Sate Klatak</strong> from Yogyakarta, unique for being grilled on iron skewers with a simple salt and garlic seasoning.</p>
        <p>These diverse types of satay are often influenced by local ingredients, traditions, and even religious practices, making satay not only a popular street food but also a symbol of Indonesia&#39s rich culinary heritage.</p>
