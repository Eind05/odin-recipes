        <h3>Rendang (Indonesian Spiced Beef Stew) </h3>
        <p>Rendang is a rich and flavorful Indonesian dish made from tender beef slowly cooked in coconut milk and a blend of aromatic spices such as lemongrass, galangal, garlic, turmeric, ginger, and chili. Originating from the Minangkabau ethnic group of West Sumatra, rendang is known for its deep, complex flavor and melt-in-the-mouth texture.
